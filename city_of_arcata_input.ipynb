Additional funding for UV equipment has been provided in part by a HUD Community Development Block Grant (CDBG).\n",

Sections of the Arcata Marsh & Wildlife Sanctuary may be temporarily closed during pre-construction bird, amphibian, and botanical surveys, during pre-construction vegetation removal, during construction and while conducting post-construction mitigation measures. Please do not remove any staking or flagging found in the project area as it is likely either marking an area cleared by biologist or an area of concern to avoid during construction.  Construction activities will be ongoing for a duration of three years, with an anticipated end date in December 2025. We thank you for your ongoing support and understanding during the construction period.\n",

Visitors to the Marsh may see water bubbling and movement under the surface of the water, or water may be discharged from the pipe above in the newly constructed outflow area. Treated wastewater cycling through the Arcata Marsh and out to Humboldt Bay provides a myriad of benefits for local wildlife and habitats. Beginning May, 2024 construction crews will start rehabilitation of primary clarifier 2. Crews will bore a new 10” bypass pipe across the plant grounds to Ox Pond 2 and start recoating the West Chlorine Contact Chamber. While the Bay Trail is closed from April 22 to May 22, crews will install new electrical duct-banks, manholes and demo the Butcher Slough wood bridge. Once the wood bridge work is complete, the existing main pipeline will be re-coated and the new metal bridge will be repaired. \n",
